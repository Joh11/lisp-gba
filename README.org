#+title: Turning the GBA into a Lisp machine

* Current plan
** Make a visual keyboard
*** Layout ?
I would like to draw inspiration from real Lisp machine keyboards,
like the space cadet:

I wanted to ues L and R for navigation through the parentheses. This
leaves only select for the modifiers, as I would like start to hide
the keyboard and A to type the selected character, B to erase it.

For simplicity let's start with a 3 rows QWERTY layout:
#+begin_example
  1234567890'
  qwertyuiop.
  asdfghjkl;,
  zxcvbnm(-+=
#+end_example

Terrible but each row is the same length at least (4 x 11). I did not include
the right parenthesis because a Lisp editor should *never* have
unmatched parentheses.

Missing characters I should add later (probably using the select modifier)
- "*/:)
- uppercase letters

*** Tiled background or sprites ?
I was thinking of using a tiled background for the layout itself, and
a sprite for the selected key.

For now I should focus on getting the tiled background up and running,
first with only two tiles: a black and a white one.

Actually start with the sprite because it is first on the Tonc
tutorial.

* Things to add later
- Proper vsync like pointed in the end of [[https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/video.htm][this tutorial]]
