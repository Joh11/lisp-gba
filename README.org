#+title: Turning the GBA into a Lisp machine

* Current plan
** Make a visual keyboard
*** Layout ?
I would like to draw inspiration from real Lisp machine keyboards,
like the space cadet:

I wanted to ues L and R for navigation through the parentheses. This
leaves only select for the modifiers, as I would like start to hide
the keyboard and A to type the selected character, B to erase it.

For simplicity let's start with a 3 rows QWERTY layout:
#+begin_example
  1234567890'
  qwertyuiop:
  asdfghjkl;,
  zxcvbnm()+=
#+end_example

Terrible but each row is the same length at least.
